# Reverse Words

Source: From Elements of Programming Interviews in Python, Q 6.6

You can reverse a string, now reverse all the words in a string. Write a function that takes in a string of words and reverses all of the words in that string.

Ex:
```
input = "mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow"
output = "yram dah a elttil bmal esohw eceelf saw etihw sa wons"
```

- **Stretch**: Don't change the positions of non-alphanumeric characters
- **Stretch**: Enforce standard capitalization rules, e.g. if the first letter of the word was capitalized then after being reversed the first letter of the reversed word is capitalized
