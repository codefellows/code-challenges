# Stringify a Number

Write a function that takes in a number and returns its fully-spelled-out version. Don't worry about dashes or commas.

Ex:
```
Input: 123
Output: "One hundred and thirty three"

Input: 2048
Output: "Two thousand and forty eight"

Input: 525600
Output: "Five hundred twenty five thousand and six hundred minutes"
