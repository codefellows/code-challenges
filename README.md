# Data Structures and Algorithms Code Challenges

Collection of whiteboard data structure/algorithm questions.

These questions are intended do be delivered the instructional team to evaluate individual student readiness for job interviews.
Question difficulty is estimated on a scale of one to five `*`'s. `*` is an "easy" problem, whereas `*****` is going to take some work and is probably of a high enough difficulty for a final whiteboarding exam.

If you have a solution for a problem that doesn't yet have one, just add it with the proper file format so that others know which languages are covered.

## Questions
