# Data Structures and Algorithms Code Challenges

This is a collection of our favorite whiteboard data structure/algorithm questions.

These questions are intended do be delivered by the instructional team to evaluate individual student readiness for job interviews.

Question difficulty is estimated on a scale of one to five `*`'s. `*` is an "easy" problem, whereas `*****` is going to take some work and is of a high enough difficulty for a **final** whiteboarding exam.

If you have a solution for a problem that doesn't yet have one, just add it with the proper file format so that others know which languages are covered.
