# {Sample Code Challenge Title}

> {A prompt, preferably as a story, that introduces the problem.}

## Example input/output

If the candidate hasn't asked for test cases by about the 5 minute mark, politely ask whether they would like a specific example.

**Inputs**

{ Inputs for an interesting, but not simple, example of the problem. }

**Outputs**

{ The expected output for those inputs. }

## Suggested data model

If the candidate hasn't provided a data model for the input and output by about the 10 minute mark, suggest this data model.

{ Data model summary, see languages for details }

### Python

```python
class Foo:
  pass
```

### Java

```java
class Foo {
  Foo() {}
}
```

### JavaScript / TypeScript

```javascript
{}
```

## Suggested algorithm

If the candidate hasn't made sufficient progress on the algorithm by about the 20 minute mark, suggest an algorithm below as a hint.

### { Solution 1 }

{ Solution summary }

#### Algorithm

{ Describe an abstract algorithm for solving the problem. }

#### Pseudocode
