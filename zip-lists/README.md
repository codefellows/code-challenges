# Zip Together Two Linked Lists

Write a function that takes in two linked lists as arguments, and returns one linked list that contains all the values zipped together:

```
list1: [ 1 ] -> [ 2 ] -> [ 3 ]
list2: [ 4 ] -> [ 5 ] -> [ 6 ]
output: [ 1 ] -> [ 4 ] -> [ 2 ] -> [ 5 ] -> [ 3 ] -> [ 6 ]
```


```
list1: [ 1 ] -> [ 2 ] -> [ 3 ]
list2: [ 4 ] -> [ 5 ] -> [ 6 ] -> [ 7 ]
output: [ 1 ] -> [ 4 ] -> [ 2 ] -> [ 5 ] -> [ 3 ] -> [ 6 ] -> [ 7 ]
```
