# Tech Abbreviations

It's becoming more and more common to abbreviate long tech jargon words in the following manner:

input word: internationalization
output: i18n

Write an algorithm that will take in a string and produce this type of abbreviation as a return value.
If the abbreviation would be longer than the actual word itself, just return the word.
