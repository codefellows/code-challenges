# Matching Leaves in a Binary Tree


Write an algorithm that will compare two trees trees together and determine if the leaves of each tree are the same. 



#Considerations
The solution attached for C# assumes the depth for the trees are the same. 
The student has to know the basic functionality of a Tree and Stack to succesfully get the solution.
<br />
An alternative solution for this probelm is to traverse through each of the trees and save the values of the leafs in an array and
then compare the two arrays against each other to confirm they are the same.
