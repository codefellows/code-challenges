# Reconstruct a BST from an In-Order Traversal

Source: From Elements of Programming Interviews in Python, Q 9.12

You are given an array of values that were the result of an in-order traversal on a balanced binary search tree.
Write a function that takes in that array as an argument and reconstructs the tree that would've given you those values in that order.
