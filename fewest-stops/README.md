# Fewest Stops Between Two Locations

You are given a map of destinations, each of which has a name and some
latitude & longitude. Destinations are connected to each other by streets.

I want to use this map to do some navigation. Write a function that will use
this map to find the route between two points that has the lowest number of
stops.
