# Is This Binary Tree Balanced?

Write a function that takes in a binary tree as an argument and returns whether or not is balanced (True or False). Here, a tree's balance is defined as the difference in depth between its left and right branches. If that difference is more than 1 (or less than -1), then the tree is out of balance.
