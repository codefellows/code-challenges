# Towers With Views
Write a function that accepts some representation of tall city towers
overlooking a pretty beach front. Return a collection of towers that
are tall enough to see the pretty beach, i.e. towers that are taller
than all other towers between themselves and the beach.

Choose your own representation of the data for both input values and return
values.

```
    #

# # # # # # # #    O C E A N
A B C D E F G H~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
```

If the above picture representing the beach and towers then only towers
`C` `F` and `H` would be included in the collection of towers that are
tall enough to have an un-blocked view.
