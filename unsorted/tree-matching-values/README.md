# Code Challenge

Find all matching values in a tree.

## Specifications
- Read all of the following instructions carefully. Name things exactly as described, or you will get a ZERO without comment 
- Do all your work in a public repository called `data-structures-and-algorithms`, with a well-formated, detailed top level README.md matching the example provided by your instructor
- Create a branch in your repository called `find_matches`
- On your branch, create...
    - _C#_: your method named `FindMatches` outside of `Main()` in your `Program.cs` file
    - _JavaScript_: a file called `find_matches.js`
    - _Python_: a file called `find_matches.py`
- Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
    - _NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository._

## Feature Tasks
- Write a function that takes a k-ary tree with non-unique values and a target value.
- Return a collection of all the nodes from within the tree that match the provided value.
- Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language.

## Structure and Testing

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define. 

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
