# Linked List isSorted
Write a function that returns true if a LinkedList is sorted.

## Part 1
Assume sorted means "all elements are in ascending order."

## Part 2
Modify the first function so it returns true whether all the elements
are in either ascending order or descending order.

```
[1, 2, 3] would be true because it's consistently ascending
[3, 2, 1] would be true because it's consistently descending
[3, 1, 2] would be false because it's inconsistent
```
