# Winning in Tic-Tac-Toe

Given a tic-tac-toe board, determine if there is a winner. If there is a winner, return the winner ("X" or "O"). If there isn't, return False. If the board is invalid (e.g. number of "X" moves and number of "O" moves aren't Â±1), an appropriate error is raised.

Ex:
```
Input: [['X', None, 'O'], [None, 'X, 'O'], ['O', None, 'X']]
Output: 'X'
```
