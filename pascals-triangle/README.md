# Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's Triangle is a collection of numbers that take a particular form:

```
    [1]
   [1,1]
  [1,2,1]
 [1,3,3,1]
[1,4,6,4,1]
```

The rows continue on forever. Assuming that row N = 1 corresponds to that first row, `[1]`, write a function that takes in N as a value and prints the first N rows of Pascal's Triangle. Note, you don't have to format the text to be indented like it is above, but each row should be contained within an array like it is above.
